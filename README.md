This OpenBantu repository contains the BantuLM ontology (i.e. the schema file) and the isiXhosa RDF dataset (i.e. the inventory file). It consists of lexical and morphological data, English translations and is linked to WordNet RDF. The data is based on the tabular noun and verb data, that was provided by Prof. Sonja Bosch (University of South Africa).
